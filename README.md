Short tutorial notebooks made to be used alongside the Planet Hunters Coffee Chat videos.

Planet Hunters Coffee chat aims to make exoplanet science more accessible to the public. It is predominantly a video series where we show how to access and use various exoplanet tools. All notebooks are also available as Colab notebooks.

For more information and links to the Colab notebooks please visit our website: www.planethunters.coffee or watch the videos at https://www.youtube.com/planethunterscoffee
